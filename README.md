# software_development_using_LLMs
We would like to develop a simple software applicatio
n for Texas Tech Universityâ€™s students. The application records the daily grocery purchased items/expenses and provides a daily/monthly report. The application will have a procedure (or a set of procedures) that takes the list of monthly groceries (in a format of your choice such as CSV or TXT)
